## Description

This project was created as a way to integrate the Swiper API into my original website. I wanted the user to be able to swipe left or right on their phones, as well as be able to use the keyboard arrows to scroll left and right. Each icon I made in Photoshop, using screenshots of the projects that each one links to. Each project was found on Codepen, and it was a way to keep a repository of cool projects on my website.
